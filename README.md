## Introduction

Oltra is a content/book/article sharing platform, where content creators, authors, intellectuals write about what they know and sell it as NFTs. its a Borderless Digital content marketplace. This platform is hosted on Boba platform.

## How it works.

This platform is DAO, meaning to be able to use the writing services or sell your book on this platform, you need to have 50 OLT. OLT tokens are stable, its equal to 1 USDT e.g 1 OLT = 1 USDT. you buy in books/contents in OLT, as an author/content creator you can withdraw your OLT Token as USDT(There's a swap functionality in the platform).

1. Users buy books as NFT and read it on site or mobile app.

2. Anti-sharing systems makes each book unique to a user thanks to NFT

2. Anti-piracy systems makes sure every book is encrypted for each user for offline use. so that contents cannot be taken from the user device
